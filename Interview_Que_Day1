Section 1: Experimental Design Interview Questions

1. How do you determine the duration of an A/B test? 
To determine the duration of an A/B test, consider the following factors:

Sample size and statistical significance: The primary factor in determining test duration is reaching a statistically significant result. 
You need a large enough sample size in each variation to confidently conclude that the observed differences are not due to chance.

Business cycle and seasonality: Consider your business cycle and seasonality when determining test duration. For example, if you're an
e-commerce site like Amazon, you may need to run tests for at least a full week to capture behavior across weekdays and weekends.

User behavior and purchasing cycle: Think about your typical user behavior and purchasing cycle. 
If you're testing a change related to a high-consideration purchase with a long decision cycle, 
you may need to run the test for several weeks to fully capture the impact on conversions.

Minimum detectable effect: The smaller the minimum improvement you want to be able to detect, the larger the sample size needed and thus the longer the test duration. 
If you only care about detecting large effects, you can reach significance faster.
"MDE is the smallest change in a metric that your experiment can detect with statistical significance."

2. What are some common pitfalls to avoid when designing an A/B test? Common pitfalls in A/B test design include:
inadequate sample sizes: enough samples in both variations
biased sampling methods: stratified clustered sampling over random(ensuring all the categories are getting covered and samples are evenly distributed).
insufficient randomization: Randomization unit- users/region 
running too many experiments at once: avoid n/w effect
In an interview, you usually want to contextualize your answer about A/B testing pitfalls to the business & team at-hand. 
For example, if you were interviewing at Uber on the Driver Growth division, here are some specific A/B testing issues you might encounter:

Difficulty isolating variables: Driver behavior is influenced by many external factors like local market conditions, seasonality, competitor activity, etc. 
This can make it challenging to isolate the impact of a specific A/B test variable.
Long time to reach statistical significance: Given the long-term nature of driver acquisition and retention, it may take months for a test to reach 
statistically-significant results on metrics like driver retention and lifetime value
Potential interference between simultaneous tests: With multiple teams likely running A/B tests concurrently on different aspects of the 
driver experience (e.g. signup flow, incentives, app features), there is risk of tests interfering with each other and confounding results.
Ethical considerations with underserved segments: If an A/B test inadvertently provides a worse experience to certain underserved driver segments, 
even if unintentional, it could have outsized negative impact on those groups.

3. How would you ensure randomization in an A/B test? 
Randomization in an A/B test can be ensured by randomly assigning participants to treatment and control groups, 
thereby minimizing the risk of bias and ensuring that the groups are comparable. Select the right randomization unit- stratified randomization.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Can you explain the concept of bucketing in the context of A/B testing? 
Bucketing refers to the process of assigning participants to treatment and control groups based on predetermined criteria, such as geographic location, 
device type, or user segment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What considerations should be made when selecting the sample size(n) for an A/B test? 
Sample size for an A/B test should be determined based on considerations such as the desired level of statistical power, expected effect size, 
baseline conversion rate, and significance level.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is a control group, and why is it important in A/B testing? 
The control group serves as a "baseline for comparison", allowing researchers to assess the impact of the treatment by comparing outcomes 
between the treatment and control groups.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. How would you handle variations in user behavior over time during an A/B test? 
Variations in user behavior over time can be addressed by conducting the test over a sufficient duration, 
ensuring that the test period covers different days of the week, times of day, and user segments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Describe the process of creating treatment groups for an A/B test. 
Treatment groups can be created by randomly assigning participants to different experimental conditions or by using 
"stratified sampling" methods to ensure that each group is representative of the population. 
Usually the in-house A/B testing framework at a company like Facebook or Uber is able to do this for you, automatically!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. What measures can be taken to minimize the impact of external factors on the results of an A/B test? 
External factors can be minimized by conducting the test in a "controlled environment" , implementing safeguards to prevent interference, 
and monitoring external events that may impact the results.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How would you determine the statistical significance level for an A/B test? 
The statistical significance level, often denoted as alpha (α), is typically set at 0.05 or 0.01, 
indicating the acceptable probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis.
It is acceptable probability of type 1 error- rejecting H0 when it is true.
